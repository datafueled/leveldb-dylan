This library wraps ``leveldb``.

Be sure to clone this recursively:

  git clone --recursive <url for repo>

To do a build, use ``make`` so that the appropriate steps
are executed.

You will also need a build of ``melange`` from the
``opendylan-melange`` repo installed in ``~/Open-Dylan/bin``.

To build on OS X, some work remains. Some work also remains
to deal with not having Google's Snappy compression library
installed.
