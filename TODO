 * leveldb-approximate-sizes needs to be wrapped correctly.
 * I currently ignore lengths returned with keys and values.
 * Would be nice to have byte-vector specializations (or just
   make it work in terms of byte-vector entirely).
 * Write tests to see that everything actually works.
 * Hook up finalization so that things don't have to be
   manually destroyed.
 * Write some getter/setter-style methods for the various
   options/readoptions/writeoptions.
 * The error checks are broken if there is no error except
   in the case of leveldb-open. This needs to be fixed.
