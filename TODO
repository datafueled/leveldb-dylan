 * leveldb-approximate-sizes needs to be wrapped correctly.
 * I currently ignore lengths returned with keys and values.
 * Would be nice to have byte-vector specializations (or just
   make it work in terms of byte-vector entirely).
 * Write tests to see that everything actually works.
 * Hook up finalization so that things don't have to be
   manually destroyed.
 * Write some getter/setter-style methods for the various
   options/readoptions/writeoptions.
 * Deal correctly with snappy not being present.
 * Deal correctly with build issues on OS X due to i386 vs
   x86_64.
